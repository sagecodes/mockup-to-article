Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
	* This project was added after I had already gone through most of the course. I can't say any new skills were learned, but it did provide maybe a good brush up on some HTML elevements I don't think of often.

What has been easy?
	* Being alreday familiar with the material made teh prject very easy.


What has been difficult?
	* As with a lot of projects in the real world, communication. The instructions could have been clearer. 

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far? 
	* I think the first project may have changed since when i first started, but I think just learning the basics of the DOM and HTML structure would have been enough to get started on the project.
